            <h4>Plane</h4>
            <p>
                Nikola Tesla (aka. Surčin) is the only international airport in Belgrade, and the largest in the country. It is directly connected with major European, Middle-Eastern and North-African airports.
            </p>
            <h4>Bus</h4>
            <p>
                Regular bus lines connect Belgrade with all parts of Serbia, while international bus lines operate to all neighboring and most European countries. The main bus station – BAS is located on the downtown Sava square, beside the Glavna (Main) train station.

Foreign drivers in Serbia are required to have a national driver’s license, traffic permit and an insurance policy. It’s good to keep in mind –  finding a parking space in Belgrade can be quite a pain.

            <h2>Getting Around</h2>
            <h3>Public Transport</h3>
            <p>
                Trams and trolleybuses ply limited routes but buses chug all over town. Rechargeable BusPlus cards can be bought and topped up (89 RSD per ticket) at kiosks across the city; they're 150 RSD if you buy from the driver. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b><br />
                Tickets are more expensive for night services (00-04), buses run at 1-hour intervals from special stops at the Republic Square towards other parts of the city. The night fare is 150 - 200 dinars and you can only buy ticket in the bus.
            </p>
            <h4>CAR:GO</h4>
            <p>
                There is no Uber in Belgrade, but there is Serbian version of it, called <a href="https://appcargo.net/en/home/" target="_blank" title="Car:Go">CAR:GO</a>, which is a bit cheaper than taxi. And also chek <a href="http://www.liftago.com/" target="_blank" title="Liftago">Liftago</a> if you like it more.
            </p>
            <h4>Taxi</h4>
            <p>
                Belgrade taxi service is cheap, and taxi can be hailed in the street. The price is calculated according to the distance travelled. Sometimes dishonest taxi drivers take advantage of tourists so our advice is: use only established taxi companies. Taxi vehicle must have: (TAXI sign bearing the association's logo on the roof, valid price-list placed to be visible to passenger, and identification card with driver's photo and address placed to be visible to passenger).
