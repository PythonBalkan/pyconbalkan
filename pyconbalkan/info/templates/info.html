            <h1>Welcome to Belgrade</h1>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>
                Welcome to Belgrade with some of the most attractive locations,
                Belgrade Fortress – the oldest cultural and historical monument, Skadarlija – the bohemian quarter in the city centre,
                Knez Mihailova street; Old and New Royal Court, Federal Parliament, Temple of St. Sava, Zemun and many others, Belgrade makes the cultural
                centre of South East Europe.
                <br><br>
                Proudly named the city of culture, inspiration, sports, and festivals. With some of the most attractive locations,
                Belgrade Fortress – the oldest cultural and historical monument, Skadarlija – the bohemian quarter in the city centre,
                Knez Mihailova street; Old and New Royal Court, Federal Parliament, Temple of St. Sava, Zemun and many others,
                Belgrade makes the cultural centre of South East Europe.
            </p>
            <h3>Bohemian style</h3>
            <p>
                Discover the Old with the New. Skadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century.
                Skadarlijan inns or kafanas have hosted many celebrities over the decades, such as Alfred Hitchcock, Jimi Hendrix, Josip Broz Tito,
                King Juan Carlos I of Spain, chess player Anatoly Karpov and many others. The present Skadarlija, a short and curved street,
                is a remarkable attraction with some of the famous inns Tri šešira (Three Hats), Šešir moj (This old hat of mine), Dva jelena (Two Deer),
                Zlatni bokal (The Golden Chalice), Ima dana (There will be days), Putujuci glumac (Traveling Actor) and Dva bela goluba (Two White Doves).
            </p>
            <h3>Belgrade fortress</h3>
            <p>
                Never changing pespective. Belgrade Fortress, known as Kalemegdan, is a defensive structure built around 3rd century,
                and is the core and oldest section of the city. It overlooks the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers.
                Тhe spot next to the statue Pobednik (The Victor), done by the famous sculptor, Ivan Meštrović, is probably the most beautiful lookout in
                Belgrade.
            </p>
            <h3>Zemun</h3>
            <p>
                Once a separate city, Zemun is nowadays known as a romantic and poetic part of Belgrade. In its main street (Glavna ulica),
                it has a Homeland museum and Madlenianum Opera and Theatre, that underlines the beauty of this street with beautiful sopranos,
                tenors, baritones and basses of renowned national and international opera singers. The bank of the Danube where Zemun is situated,
                Zemunski kej, is a kilometreslong promenade with barges-cafés, an amusement park and formerly largest hotel in Belgrade, now Grand Casino.
                At night, these barges-cafés are the epicentre of a night life, open until dawn. Gardoš Tower is the most recognizable symbol of Zemun.
                This neighborhood preserved its old looks, with narrow, mostly cobblestoned streets and individual residential houses.
                There is a cute café/restaurant near the Gardoš tower that offers a panoramic view of Belgrade and a pleasant rest from the sounds of city traffic.

            <h2>How to get to Belgrade</h2>
            <p>
                Belgrade is located between the Balkan peninsula and Central Europe, on the Danube and Sava rivers,
                and the intersection of major European road corridors E10 & E75.
            </p>

            <h3>By air</h3>

            <p>
            <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/nikola-tesla-international-airport/">
                Nikola Tesla (aka. Surčin)
            </a> is the only international airport in Belgrade, and the largest in the country.
                It is directly connected with major European, Middle-Eastern and North-African airports.
            </p>

            <h3>By train</h3>
            <p>
                Belgrade is connected by train to all major European capitals. Have in mind that most trains in Serbia are old and slow,
                though it’s a unique experience worth trying.
                In the last few years, Belgrade has become an important spot on European InterRail itineraries.
                If you’re coming to Belgrade by train, you’ll most probably get to one of it’s three main stations:
                <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/main-glavna-train-station/" target="_blank">Glavna</a>, New Belgrade or Prokop.
            </p>

            <h3>By bus (COACH)</h3>
            <p>
                Regular bus lines connect Belgrade with all parts of Serbia, while international bus lines operate to all
                neighboring and most European countries. The main bus station – BAS is located on the downtown Sava square,
                beside the Glavna (Main) train station.
            </p>

            <h3>By car</h3>
            <p>
                Belgrade is located at the intersection of the European E-70 and E-75 highways,
                connecting Central Europe with Southeastern Europe and the Middle East,
                and therefore a convenient stop if traveling to Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, etc.
                Foreign drivers in Serbia are required to have a national driver’s license,
                traffic permit and an insurance policy.
                It’s good to keep in mind – <strong>people in Belgrade are known for their “wild” driving.</strong>
                Another useful information:
                finding a parking space in Belgrade can be quite a pain. More info on parking
                <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/parking-and-garages-in-belgrade/" target="_blank"> here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>By bike</h3>
            <p>
                Belgrade is located on the crossing of two European EuroVelo cycling routes – EuroVelo 6 and EuroVelo 11.
                However, the old town in Belgrade is not too bicycle friendly. There are about 65 kilometers of bicycle paths in the city at the moment,
                but mostly in <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/novi-beograd/" target="_blank"> New Belgrade</a> and the
                <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/section/sightseeing/parks/" target="_blank">recreation zones</a>.
                Same precaution as the above is advised: <strong>be cautious with the wild traffic!</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>By boat</h3>
            <p>
                Belgrade has an international passenger terminal known as <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/belgrade-port/" target="_blank">
                Belgrade (Sava) Port</a>, just below <a href="http://belgrademyway.com/kalemegdan-park-and-belgrade-fortress/">
                Kalemegdan</a> (the fortress), and the number of Danube cruises stopping in Belgrade is growing.
                There are numerous marinas and docking facilities along the rivers, if you’re coming with your own boat.
                At the moment there aren’t any regular lines between Belgrade and other Danube cities, but some Belgrade-based cruisers
                offer cruises to Novi Sad and Djerdap for organized groups.
            </p>

                and identification card with driver's photo and address placed to be visible to passenger).
